Task Description:
You are presented with two sets of sentences, Set 1 and Set 2. Each set contains sentences around a common theme. Your task is to evaluate each set based on their adherence to commonsense (quality) and their diversity, focusing particularly on redundancy within the sets. Subtle differences in reasoning or approach should also be recognized. The sentence sets should be cohesive around the same theme, and diversity should be considered in terms of exploring different aspects of that theme.

Important Notes:

It is crucial to pay close attention to which sentences are in Set 1 and which are in Set 2 when making your evaluations. Do not assume any set is superior by default in quality or diversity.

Evaluate each set independently based on its own content. 

Quality Evaluation Criteria:

Commonsense Adherence: Sentences must be realistic and describe plausible real-world scenarios without factual inaccuracies.

Subtlety in Reasoning: Recognize and value subtle differences in reasoning or approach that enhance the exploration of the theme.

Quality Scoring Guidelines (for each set):

5 Points: All sentences are realistic, coherent, and enhance the theme through subtle reasoning.

4 Points: Most sentences are realistic and coherent, with some subtle differences enhancing the theme.

3 Points: Sentences are generally realistic but may lack subtlety or have minor issues.

2 Points: Several sentences are unrealistic or contain factual errors.

1 Point: Most sentences are unrealistic, incoherent, or contain significant factual errors.


Diversity Evaluation Criteria:

Low Redundancy: Sentences should exhibit low lexical and semantic similarity.

Degree of Redundancy: Sets with more paraphrased sentences or repetitive themes have lower diversity.

Comprehensive Diversity: The sentences in the sets should enrich the theme without compromising realism and common sense.

Diversity Scoring Guidelines (for each set):

5 Points: Sentences explore a wide range of aspects of the theme with low redundancy.

4 Points: Sentences cover different aspects of the theme with minimal redundancy.

3 Points: Sentences have some diversity but noticeable redundancy.

2 Points: Sentences are mostly repetitive with limited exploration of the theme.

1 Point: Sentences are highly redundant with almost no diversity.

Output:
Based on the above criteria, assign a separate score for quality and diversity to each set, ranging from 1 to 5 points.
