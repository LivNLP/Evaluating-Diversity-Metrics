Decide which model's sentence is better in terms of the naturalness and commonness of the scenes they describe. \n\n## Rules: \n- A better sentence should describe a common scene in daily life, and all concepts should be used in a natural way.\n- You should prefer sentences that use all given concepts with correct part-of-speech tags. \n- A simpler and shorter sentence is preferred if it describes the same scene as the other sentence.\n- If you think both sentences are equally good or bad, please choose \"tie\".\n\nNow, please output your choice (\"A\" or \"B\" or \"tie\").\n\nYour choice: "
