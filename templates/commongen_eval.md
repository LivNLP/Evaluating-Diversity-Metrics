# Data

Given several concepts (i.e., nouns or verbs), we ask models to write sentences that contains *all* the required words. 
The sentences should describe common scene in daily life, and the concepts should be used in a natural way.

Concepts: "{concept_list}"

Model A: "{candidate_A}"

Model B: "{candidate_B}"

# Your Task

Your task is to choose better sentence sets from the two candidates. Decide which model's sentence is better in terms of the naturalness and commonness of the scenes they describe. 

## Rules: 
- A better sentence should describe a common scene in daily life, and all concepts should be used in a natural way.
- You should prefer sentences that use all given concepts with correct part-of-speech tags. 
- A simpler and shorter sentence is preferred if it describes the same scene as the other sentence.
- If you think both sentences are equally good or bad, please choose "tie".

Now, please output your choice ("A" or "B" or "tie").
